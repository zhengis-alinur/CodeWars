# CodeWars
This repository created for myself to improve my programming skill by using codewars.com, where I find some interesting problems to solve.

This repository created mostly to see my skill's growing up. 

In codewars there are levels named kyu, so I created such packages for every level, where I will put my solutions, and not only. In every task's package you can find readme.md, where you can find a description and the best solution for this task foung in codewars.com.
